# RiboPipe

**RiboPipe** is a robust and versatile analysis pipeline to identify co-translationally imported mitochondrial proteins in zebrafish. 

**PLEASE NOTE:** RiboPipe is currently under the development and so far two parts have been completed: 

**GO.R -** an algorithm for functional annotation that is also suitable for human and mouse.

**show.GO.R -** an algorithm for visualization of functional annotation results
